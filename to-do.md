The code is now complete, to match the architecture document
Need to go through temp.md to move the code into the correct structure
this could be a soft launch (as-is)
consider passing the architecture document, code, or both through Claude before release, double check
the escalation part of the solution is not done yet - decide if this is done before release or release now and fix later
the policies are still too hard to write and understand - review discovery_policy file to understand
maybe good idea to include in the CLI a way to scan existing agent code and recommend or generate policy YAML files
the code has not been tested yet - it should be tested before release
